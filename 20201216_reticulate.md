We had a virtual meetup event where we discussed leveraging Python within R and RStudio using the reticulate (https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) R package on December 16, 2020 at our [R-Ladies event](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-baltimore/events/273328125/):

In preparation, Tiffany asked for folks who would like to follow along, please follow these installation/setup instructions: https://github.com/ttimbers/intro-to-reticulate.

The plan is for Tiffany to live demo the setup after you have installed Python via miniconda (this takes a while, so this should be done before the meetup). Then, she will demo using Python in RStudio, writing and running scripts, and using Python in R Markdown files. We will upload the artifacts that are created during the meetup afterwards, which we can send around after the meetup.
